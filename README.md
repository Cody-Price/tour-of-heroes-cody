# Tour of Heroes

Tour of Heroes is an Angular 7 application that allows the user to add/delete/edit various heroes from a heroes database while providing dynamic routing to aforementioned heroes.

This project was my first Angular project that I have ever written as part of the Angular 7 CLI tutorial. I assigned myself this project in order to expand my programming vocabulary.
